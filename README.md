Multiple-Iteration-Creation
===========================

Creates Multiple Iterations at one time for a single project.  The iterative velocity is calculated automatically based on the average velocity of the last 3 iterations, but can be manually over-ridden.  Date calculation and iteration name are attempted to be automated based on present and/or past iterations.  Length and Theme are copied from current or previous iteration as well.<P>

<B>NOTE: the limitation on this app is that it must be used in the same time zone as the subscription setting.  Otherwise, one day adjustments may need to be made to either start or end dates.</B><P>
